For readability and beauty, this section of code should had this format:

    Header --> t_header("text")
    Description --> t_description("text") #(Optional)
    Select --> t_select("text") #if the section has choices
    print("\n")
    Message --> t_info("text") | t_error("text") | ... #This part is after the operation, if you have an message for user (Optional)
    and print("\n") for space between all sections

All the functions mentioned are implemented in the "output.py"
All the functions mentioned have their own color


for exampel:

    Profile page --> t_header("Profile page")
    0.back --> t_select("0.back")
    1.Edit Profile --> t_select("1.Edit Profile")
    2.View posts --> t_select("2.View posts")
    3.Setting --> t_select("3.Setting")

    and next section...


Or this exampel:

    Please enter your username: --> t_header("Please enter your username:")
    if you want back enter 0 --> t_description("Enter 0 for back")
    #User enter its username

    The operation was successful --> m_success("The operation was successful")

    and next section...



All users can exit the program at any time by entering "exit" and also with "0" they can return to the previous page.

for exampel:
    while(True)
        command == input()
        if input == "exit":
            quit()
        elif input == "0":
            break | return Pre_page()   #Instead of "Pre_page()", the functions "Home()" or "Profile()" or etc are used



Use this format for debugging:
    
    try:
        if(condition):
            #code
        else:
        raise Except("text of error")
    except Except as e:
        m_error(e)



To store data in JSON, you must first make your changes in dictionaries "Users" and "Posts", then use this code:

    #for users
    with open("database/users.json","w") as json_file:
        json.dump(Users, json_file, indent=3)

    #for posts
    with open("database/posts.json","w") as json_file:
        json.dump(Posts, json_file, indent=3)



It is recommended that you make a backup of your code on your local system

good luck...
